# Set up Create React App with Express

This is a repository for an article I wrote on what is the first step on building full stack JS apps. The main topic is how we can use create-react-app with Express for the beginners. I explained the steps as how I think the beginners will understand it. And I hope they'll learn from this article and not feel overwhelmed.

If it's not yet working, it means I haven't released the article. (Release Date: 04/09/19) Blog Post Link: https://wp.me/p8n6rQ-8L

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert yet. I just want to share the things I learned when I built my full stack JS apps.
